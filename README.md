  ## 1. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>
  In todayâ€™s competitive retail landscape, companies like CitiShop face a variety of challenges, including optimizing inventory levels, understanding customer behavior, and predicting future sales trends. These challenges, if not addressed, can result in overstocking, stockouts, and missed opportunities for personalized marketing.

This project aims to analyze CitiShop's sales data to uncover key insights into customer purchasing patterns and product performance. Through data-driven analysis and the development of predictive machine learning models, the goal is to improve demand forecasting, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer segmentation. Additionally, performance metrics such as accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE) will be employed to measure the effectiveness of the models. By leveraging data science techniques, CitiShop can enhance its operational efficiency and overall customer experience.

## 2. Dataset <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, an open platform offering a wide range of datasets for analysis. This particular dataset is a generic retail sales dataset, which has been adapted for the purpose of analyzing CitiShop, a fictional retail company created for this project. Although the dataset does not originally represent CitiShop, it is being used as a basis to simulate real-world retail challenges and scenarios.

**Dataset Features:**
The dataset contains 1,000 entries, each representing a retail transaction. It includes both numerical and categorical data across 9 columns, representing typical features in retail transactions:

- Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- Date: The date on which the transaction took place.
- Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
- Gender: The gender of the customer (Male, Female).
- Age: The age of the customer.
- Product Category: The category of the product purchased (e.g.,Beauty, Clothing, Electronics).
- Quantity: The number of units purchased in each transaction.
- Price per Unit: The price for each unit of the product purchased.
- Total Amount: The total value of the transaction, calculated as - Quantity * Price per Unit.
